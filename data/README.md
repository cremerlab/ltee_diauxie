## `data`

This directory houses all small (< 100 MB) data sets that are a result of
individual experiments and/or simulations. They are partitioned into the following 
categories

* **`calibration/`**: This includes all experiments performed as calibration to 
permit quantitative characterization. This includes calibration of the HPLC to 
tie peak area to concentration.

* **`growth_curves/`**: This includes all data for the determination of growth 
rates and/or lag times. This includes optical density meeasurements taken by 
hand at the spectrophotometer as well as measurements on a plate reader. 

* **`metabolite_turnover/`**: This includes all HPLC data for the measurement 
of the consumption and/or production of metabolites. 

* **`literature/`**: This includes all data from the literature which is used 
appropariately with citation.
